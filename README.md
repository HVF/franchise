# Franchise from Ksenia
*a sql notebook*

Franchise is a lightweight but powerful SQL tool with a notebook interface. You can use it online at [franchise.cloud](https://franchise.cloud).

[![Franchise is pretty cool](https://franchise.cloud/images/landing-gif.gif)](https://franchise.cloud)

- There's no **sign up** and **no install**
    - For editing CSVs, JSON, XLSX files, we've integrated [js-xlsx](https://github.com/SheetJS/js-xlsx), and [sql.js](https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/) so you can query data entirely locally in your browser
    - For connecting to **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, or **BigQuery**, just run a single command in your terminal to open a bridge that allows Franchise to directly connect to your database. Your data never touches a third party server.
- Chart with a single click
- Compare queries side by side
    - With our [unique notebook layout engine](https://github.com/antimatter15/breadloaf), you can drag and drop cells on the same line to compare views.
